Linker is system software which plays crucial role in software development because it enables separate compilation.
Instead of organizing a large application as one monolithic source file, you can decompose it into smaller, more manageable
chunks that can be modified and compiled separately. When you change one of the modules, you simply recompile it
and re-link the application, without recompiling the other source files.
